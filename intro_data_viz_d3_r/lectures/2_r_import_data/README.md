## Introduction to Data Visualization With D3 and R

### This is an introduction to interactive data visualization. 

In this tutorial, we will be making a scatterplot **visualizing maternity leave amongst OECD countries.** We will be working primarily with **D3.js** and use a little bit of **R** to get us started. To get started in this course, you will need a basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you are little rusty with JS, don't feel bad – JS is hard. It would be weird if it came naturally. You are good enough!

In the YouTube description of each video, I will link to the corresponding code on Github.

### Download these things before you start:

1. A code editor. I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html). R is a statistical programming language that makes it easy to analyze data! It actually is fun.
3. [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) This is a special IDE (that's an integrated development environment – a fancy code editor!) for the R language that has become widely adopted.
4. [Tabula](https://tabula.technology/) This let's you download data tables from PDF files (It's cooler than it sounds!)

#### Data links (You don't have to download these, the data is already in the repo!)
1. [OECD Parental Leave Systems](http://www.oecd.org/els/soc/PF2_1_Parental_leave_systems.pdf)
2. [GDP Per hour worked](https://data.oecd.org/lprdty/gdp-per-hour-worked.htm)

### You are good enough!

You can do this. I wasn't too long ago that I nearly gave up on this artistic, creative career because I didn't think I was capable. I thought this was for people who did maths (Maths is for extremely intelligent British people). I had flashbacks of office hours in a tiny room with all the other liberal arts majors who also needed to take Math and Politics to fulfill their quanitative reasoning requirement. 

This will be more fun, I promise. The goal is to adventually make engaging, colorful graphics that can communicate ideas alongside more traditional forms. But for now, we must learn the basics. 

Learning the basics is so important. One of the characteristics of D3 is that it is its own flavor (caramel?) infused on top of vanilla JS. This makes it especially challenging for beginners to master both at once. I will try my best throughout the course to address the JS concepts that are so integral to working alongside D3.

Learning is to code can fun. A whole world opened up for me when I learned. I'm kind of jealous of you. Jealous of the discovery, not so much the stugggle. Although both are necessary.

 It's good to feel frustrated – that means you are learning!

Good luck! You are good enough. It took me six months for me to even begin to understand any of this. And I'm still far from the best. So consider yourself an enlightened beginner ;)
